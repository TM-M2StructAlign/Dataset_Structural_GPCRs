# GPCRdb Structural Alignment Benchmark Dataset

This repository provides a comprehensive benchmark dataset for the evaluation of **multiple sequence alignment (MSA) methods**, with a particular emphasis on **structure-aware and transmembrane-aware alignment of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)**.

The dataset integrates **sequence data, AlphaFold2-predicted structures, distance matrices, transmembrane region annotations, reference alignments**, and **processed alignment results** obtained from multiple software tools.

It is designed to support **reproducible research** in structural bioinformatics, topology-aware alignment, and multi-objective optimization of MSAs.

**Dataset Overview:**
- **Total human GPCR sequences:** 284 (or 133 in the reduced 19-protein version)
- **GPCR classes covered:** 9 main classes/subclasses
- **Sequence sources:** UniProt, NCBI, and GPCRdb
- **Structure data:** AlphaFold2 predictions (JSON and PDB formats)
- **Alignment tools evaluated:** sequence-based baselines plus major structure-based tools
- **New additions:** dedicated experiment outputs and workflow scripts for Mustang, Caretta, mTM-align, FoldMason, and US-align

## Dataset Versions

The dataset is provided in **two complementary versions** to support different experimental scenarios.

### 1. Full Dataset (Complete Version)

The complete dataset includes **all available human GPCR sequences** grouped by biologically meaningful subclasses. This version is intended for:

- Large-scale MSA benchmarking
- Statistical and evolutionary analysis
- Scalability evaluation of alignment algorithms

**Composition of the full dataset:**

| Class (group)                    | Number of sequences |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Class Aα (Rhodopsin – Aminergic) | 36                  |
| Class Aβ (Rhodopsin – Peptide)   | 76                  |

| Class F (Frizzled)               | 11                  |
| Class T2 (Taste 2)               | 25                  |
| **Total**                        | **284**             |

Sequence characteristics:
- **Length range:** Approximately 290 to 6,000+ amino acids
- **Longest sequences:** Adhesion GPCRs (Class B2), with multiple extracellular domains
- **Alignment focus:** Transmembrane (TM) regions identified and extracted
- **Sequence coverage:** All major human GPCR classes and well-studied subfamilies

---

### 2. Reduced Dataset (_19 Version)

A reduced version of the dataset was constructed, containing **exactly 19 proteins per class/subclass** (where applicable).

This version was created to accommodate methodological constraints of certain structure-based alignment tools:

> Dong et al., *mTM-align: an algorithm for fast and accurate multiple protein structure alignment*, Bioinformatics, 34:1719–1725 (2018)

The original **mTM-align** implementation enforces a hard limit of **19 PDB structures per input**.

**Reduced Dataset Composition:**
- **9 classes/subclasses** with 19 proteins each (where sufficient data exists)
- **Total sequences:** 133 proteins (vs. 284 in full version)
- **Suffix notation:** `_19` appended to class names (e.g., `classA_001_19`)
- **Purpose:** Enable direct comparison of all 5 alignment tools, including structure-based methods

## Data Components and Usage

### Sequences (`sequences/`)
- **FASTA files:** High-quality protein sequences in FASTA format
- **Dataset Summary:** CSV file with metadata for all sequences
- **GFF3 annotations:** Gene feature format annotations
- **Transmembrane regions:** Pre-identified and annotated TM regions for each protein

### Structural Data
- **AlphaFold2 Structures:** 
  - **PDB format** (`alphafold_pdb/`): Standard PDB files for visualization and structure analysis
  - **JSON format** (`alphafold_json/`): Structured format with metadata, confidence scores (pLDDT), and PAE (Predicted Aligned Error)

### Derived Data
- **Distance Matrices** (`distances/`): Pairwise distance matrices computed from 3D structures
- **Weights** (`weights/`): Pre-computed alignment weights and scoring matrices

### Reference Alignments (`reference_alignments/`)
Gold-standard alignments curated from:
- **UniProt/GPCRdb reference alignments**
- **Manually validated structural alignments**

## Software Evaluation Results

The repository now contains both baseline sequence-based alignments and a dedicated set of structural-alignment experiments. The main resources are organized as follows:

| Tool | Category | Repository location | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ClustalW / Kalign / MAFFT / T-Coffee** | Sequence-based baselines | GPCRdb/resultados_software/ | Standard MSA outputs organized by GPCR class |
| **mTM-align** | Structure-based | Tests/mtmalign/ | Per-dataset execution folders and parallel log files |
| **Mustang** | Structure-based | Tests/mustang/ | Class-based result folders for structural alignment experiments |
| **Caretta** | Structure-based | Tests/caretta/ | Includes execution summary, global logs, and per-dataset outputs |
| **FoldMason** | Structure-based | Tests/foldmason/ | Dataset-level result directories generated by the workflow script |
| **US-align** | Structure-based | Tests/usalign/ | Batch outputs produced from the US-align workflow |

**Results organization:**
- Each tool has its own result directory under Tests/
- The outputs are organized by GPCR class, including both full and reduced (_19) datasets where applicable
- A consolidated summary of precomputed results is available in GPCRdb/precomputed/resultados_precomputed.txt

### Structural-alignment workflow scripts
- scripts/mustang_run.sh
- scripts/run_caretta.sh
- scripts/ejecutar_mtmalign_parallel.sh
- scripts/run_foldmason.sh
- scripts/run_usalign.sh

These scripts automate the execution of the structure-based workflows and prepare the result folders used for downstream analysis.

## Usage Example

To evaluate a new MSA method on this dataset:

1. Use FASTA sequences from `sequences/fasta/`
2. Optionally incorporate structural information from `alphafold_pdb/` or `alphafold_json/`
3. Compare results against `reference_alignments/`
4. Benchmark against outputs in `resultados_software/`
5. Use `distances/` or `weights/` for structure-aware scoring

For structure-based methods, extract PDB files from the corresponding class directory.
